Look close at the palace where the royals reside,  
Four Kings and four Queens, each one in command.  
But what holds their gaze, what makes them all stare?  
It is the Joker who is dancing, free as the air.  

Who holds the power? The Kings with their pride,  
Or the Queens with their elegance, poised by their side?  
They rule by the book, by tradition and might,  
While the Joker spins free, both shadow and light.  

The Kings and Queens give him their time,  
Drawn by his chaos, his rhythm, his rhyme.  
Master or fool? It is hard to say,  
For he is bound to no rule, no game they play.  

So who is the King, and who plays the fool?  
The Joker holds sway in this court and this rule.  
With no throne to his name, no crown on his head,  
Yet he leads, with a laugh, wherever he is led.

*We take ourselves so seriously, building our courts and wearing our crowns. But the moment the Joker enters, dancing out of step, laughing at our solemn pronouncements, we realize how fragile our authority is. Power, when examined too closely, reveals itself as a puppet show. And the Joker is the only one who knows he is holding the strings.*
