Sometimes the best adventures are the ones you never see coming. Last June, amidst recovering from a food poisoning episode, coming back from home and scrambling to catch up on my missed subjects in Delhi, my friend Salim showed up unannounced. His mission? A spontaneous, budget-friendly trip across India. What followed was a chaotic, hilarious, and soul-stirring journey to Manali, a trip that taught me to embrace the messiness of life and the beauty of unexpected detours.

## Chapter 1: Delhi Detours

Salim landed at my Delhi PG in the last week of June, armed with ₹600 and an empty backpack. We kicked things off with a food marathon, sharing plates of butter-laden parathas and chai from my favorite dhaba. Between bites, I dragged him to Delhi's iconic spots. He persuaded me to join in his adventure and after some quick thoughts I decided to join. And that was the best decision of my life.

## Chapter 2: The ₹600 "Budget" Escape to Manali

Salim's grand plan seemed impossible on paper, but that's the thing about plans, they rarely survive contact with reality. We squeezed into crowded buses, shared meals with strangers, and slept in places that would make a germophobe weep. But in that ₹600 constraint, we discovered a freedom that money cannot buy.

The mountains welcomed us with indifferent beauty. Manali did not care about our budget or our plans. It simply existed, magnificent and unmoving, while we scrambled through its streets with our small dramas and smaller wallets.

I remember sitting on a rock overlooking the valley, the cold wind cutting through my thin jacket, thinking about how close I came to saying no. How easily we dismiss the possibility of joy because it comes wrapped in inconvenience.

The trip taught me that the strings we think bind us are often of our own making. Cut them, and you might just find you can fly.
