If you are tired of clickbait "cutoff prediction" videos, this is for you.

**Key Data Points:**
- Total candidates selected for CBT2: 20,792
- Total vacancies: 1,377

The numbers do not lie, though we often lie to ourselves about what they mean. In a country of billions, thousands compete for hundreds of spots. The mathematics of ambition is brutal and unforgiving.

I have watched friends prepare for years. I have seen the toll it takes: the sleepless nights, the fraying relationships, the slow erosion of self-worth that comes from repeatedly being measured and found wanting.

The cutoff becomes a villain, a line drawn in the sand by anonymous authorities. But the cutoff is just an effect, not a cause. It rises because we all perform better under pressure, because the coaching centers have industrialized preparation, because desperation breeds excellence.

There is something deeply wrong about a system where so many are trained so well for so few positions. It is a lottery where we pretend skill determines the outcome. Skill matters, yes, but luck matters too. The day you fall sick. The questions that happen to align with your preparation. The examiner's mood.

I do not have solutions. I have only observations. The system will not change because you or I are tired. It will change when the cost of maintaining it exceeds the cost of reform. Until then, we are all just numbers, hoping to be among the selected few.

To those who made it: celebrate, but remember the statistics. To those who did not: the cutoff is a measure of a test, not a measure of your worth. The world is vast, and this exam is a door, not the house.
