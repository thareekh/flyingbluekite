Lately, the rising crime in Kerala haunts me. Not as headlines, but as human fractures, stories screaming to be told. I want to write hyperrealistic fiction through the eyes of the guilty, not the victims. To crawl into the mind of a perpetrator and trace the rot: the first lie, the moment of dehumanization, the unraveling.

Kerala was always the model state, the educated paradise, God's own country. But gods have dark sides too. Behind the lush greenery and backwaters, something festers. Or perhaps that is just my writer's mind, always searching for the narrative in the noise.

I am not interested in justifying crime. I am interested in the architecture of it. How does a person move from "I would never" to "I had no choice"? Is it a bridge or a cliff? Do they jump or are they pushed?

The newspapers give us the what and the who. The courts eventually give us the judgment. But literature can give us the how and the why. It can make us sit in the uncomfortable realization that under different circumstances, given different pressures, we might recognize ourselves in the accused.

That is not to say everyone is capable of everything. I do not believe that. But the capacity for rationalization, for slowly moving the moral goalposts, inch by inch, until you are scoring in your own net and calling it victory; that feels universal.

The stories I want to write are not about monsters. They are about men and women who made a series of small, wrong turns until they were miles from where they meant to be, with no road back. The tragedy is not just in the victim. It is also in the moment before the crime, when the perpetrator still had a choice, and chose wrong.

Kerala will be my backdrop because I know its sounds, its smells, its particular brand of politeness that masks judgment. But the stories could happen anywhere. That is the point. The geography changes. The human architecture of error remains constant.
